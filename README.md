Source files of "Lecture notes for Intro to Stochastic Processes", University
of Texas at Austin. The rendered book is at
[gordanz.github.io/stochastic-book](https://gordanz.github.io/stochastic-book/).

These notes are written in Rmarkdown. Core examples/simulations are written in
R/tidyverse. Examples and graphs in the Markov Chains section and later are
(mostly) produced using the R package *chapman-r* available at CRAN or at
[gordanz/chapman-r](https://github.com/gordanz/chapman-r).
